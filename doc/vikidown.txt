INTRODUCTION                                    *vikidown*

vikidown is a tool that translates Vimwiki syntax to Markdown and vice versa.
It also supports batch conversions of multiple wiki/md files. It saves new
file in the same directory as the original file.


COMMANDS                                        *vikidown-commands*

General philosophy around naming is as follows:

    VikiMd   <--  Viki(vimwiki) gets translated to Md(Markdown)
    VikiMdAll   <--  VikiMd applied to all files in the same directory.

                                                *:VikiMd*
:VikiMd                 Converts currently opened Vimwiki file to markdown
                        and saves the file with the same name with .md
			extension in the same directory.

                                                *:MdViki*
:MdViki                 Converts currently opened markdown file to Vimwiki
                        and saves the file with the same name with .wiki
			extension in the same directory.

                                                *:VikiMdAll*
:VikiMdAll              Converts Vimwiki files in the same directory with
                        .wiki extension to markdown.

                                                *:MdVikiAll*
:MdVikiAll              Converts Markdown files in the same directory with
